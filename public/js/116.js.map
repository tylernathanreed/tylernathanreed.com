to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure.\r\n                It makes you write labor-savor programs that other people will find useful,\r\n                and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n                <b>Impatience</b> is the anger you feel when the computer is being lazy.\r\n                This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them.\r\n                This quality also drives you to write more efficient code, so that you don't have to wait\r\n                around for the program to finish.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n                <b>Hubris</b> is the quality that makes you write (and maintain)

DRY problems come in many forms.\r\n                Here is a breakdown of the common violations that I see, and what their solutions should be:\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <b>1)</b> Copy, Paste, Tweak\r\n                <br><br>\r\n                Whether it's models, views, controllers, or another complex class, I often see developers needing to stand up functionality\r\n                that is similar to existing functionality. Their first approach is typically to copy the entire class or architecture,\r\n                then proceed to paste and rename it under a different namespace or class name, and lastly make the small handful of changes that\r\n                they needed.\r\n                <br><br>\r\n                This results in having two strikingly similar processes, but they don't actually <i>share</i> this functionality\r\n                at a definitional level. The proper approach would have been to abstract the existing implementation, then define the existing\r\n                implementation as just one of the concrete mechanisms, and lastly describe their new functionality as a second concrete implementation.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <b>2)</b> Different Implementations for each Use Case\r\n                <br><br>\r\n                In some of the financially focused applications I've worked on, we've naturally had several financial calculations.\r\n                Some of these calculations were rather complex, and could be broken down into smaller pieces. However, instead of\r\n                giving each piece its own calculation, you'd see the complex calculations internally calculate the smaller components\r\n                by hand, rather than delegating the calculation to a function that could be shared by the larger calculations.\r\n                <br><br>\r\n                The justification for this is usually, \"I only need a specific part of the smaller calculation, so I just put it in there\".\r\n                This is a very bad idea. You'll eventually end up with a gray definition of some of the smaller building blocks in your\r\n                application, and some of these \"specific calculations\" could actually be <i>wrong</i>. What's worse, is that diagnosing\r\n                the issue is made even harder, as you don't really have a source of truth anymore.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </portfolio-modal>\r\n\r\n        <portfolio-modal :item=\"practices.deeper\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                Let's Go Deeper is a design pattern I came up with, and honestly it applies to more than just code.\r\n                The idea behind LGP is that you design your code (or thought process) at a high level end-to-end,\r\n                and allow diving deeper into specific aspects at the readers discretion.\r\n                This helps give the reader a broad overview, and doesn't bore them with specifics.\r\n                Additionally, if they need specifics, they have an easy time choosing with avenues to explore.\r\n                When done correctly, your source code often looks like a \"Choose Your own Adventure\" book,\r\n                and the entry point is just a chapter outline.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Here's an example of LGP when applied to business requirements:\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <b>1)</b> Objective\r\n                <br><br>\r\n                The objective should be an elevator pitch, and is ideally one or two sentences.\r\n                You want to explain what it is you're trying to do, but not go into <i>how</i>\r\n                you're going to do it.

Here's the calculation for the regular payment: <code>$pmt = $pv * ($r * ((1 + $r) ^ $n)) / (((1 + $r) ^ $n) - 1)</code>.\r\n                Since you need to simulate the payment schedule, start by initialize some variables that we'll need to keep track of.\r\n                This includes the current principal (<code>$prin = $pv</code>), the current interest (<code>$int = 0</code>),\r\n                and the running breakdown (<code>$breakdown = []</code>).\r\n                We accrue interest <i>after</i> the payment, so make sure you deduct the payment first.\r\n                Within each iteration of the loop (assuming <code>$i</code> is the iterator), you'll need to calculate the following:\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>Interest Payment (<code>$breakdown[$i]['int'] = $int</code>)</li>\r\n                    <li>Remaining Payment (<code>$rem = $pmt - $int</code>)</li>\r\n                    <li>Principal Payment (<code>$breakdown[$i]['prin'] = $rem</code>)</li>\r\n                    <li>Current Principal (<code>$prin -= $rem</code>)</li>\r\n                    <li>Monthly Interest (<code>$mi = $prin * $r / 12</code>)</li>\r\n                    <li>Current Interest (<code>$int += $mi</code>)</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n                With that solved, you'll need to simulate each payment in a loop (up to <code>$n</code> times),\r\n                where you'll need to calculation the monthly interest <code>$mi = $r / 12 * $pv</code>\r\n            </p>\r\n        </portfolio-modal>\r\n\r\n        <portfolio-modal :item=\"practices.tire\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                The importance of technical communication is best summed up by this comic:\r\n                <img src=\"/images/tireswing_full.png\" class=\"w-100\"/>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                While it's funny, it's only funny because of the truth behind it.\r\n                As a software developer, I see it as my responsibility to deliver what the customer really needed,\r\n                not what they may have asked for, or what other people have described.\r\n                It's important to listen to all viewpoints on the matter, and formulate an educated solution.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                I have run into countless examples of \"tire swing\" problems, where I've been asked to implement\r\n                a specific feature, despite the fact that the feature won't solve the underlying problem.\r\n                I've learned to ask \"why\", and walk my way back to the original requirements, while also\r\n                keeping the suggestions that were initially presented.\r\n                More often than not, I provide a slightly modified solution that makes everyone happier.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </portfolio-modal>\r\n\r\n        <portfolio-modal :item=\"practices.future\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                While the problems of today certainly need attention, you cannot dedicate your entire focus to them.\r\n                I have unfortunately seen too many companies enter an endless \"fire-fighting\" mode, and struggle to\r\n                actually get on top of problems. What's worse, is that there were early warnings for many of these\r\n                issues, and they were ignored to work on the \"problem at hand\". I'm not saying you shouldn't focus\r\n                on today's problems, just ensure that your <i>entire</i> focus isn't dedicated towards them.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Once you're in an endless fire-fight of data problems, code defects, and performance issues, it can be\r\n                difficult figure out how you got there. Unfortunately, if you find yourself in that situation, it can be\r\n                even more difficult to get out it. Ideally, the team's capacity needs to increase, but under poor management,\r\n                you're more likely to see workforce reduction or people quitting.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Whether it be forecasting completion dates to measure against deadlines, running \"health check\" recons\r\n                again your database to identify core issues, or having the foresight as a developer to plan for upcoming\r\n                features, there are a number of ways to protect against the problems of the future. It's incredibly important\r\n                to give these problems the attention they deserve. While they may not immediately effect you now, they'll\r\n                definitely effect you in the future. If you treat warnings of future problems like many people treat global warming,\r\n                the world will end up on fire, and you'll be left in confusion while the forecasters of the world say \"I told you so\".\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                I've unfortunately seen this situation in more than one company I've worked at, and it always stemmed from\r\n                management not appealing to the warnings of the developers or analysts. Even if they did listen, it was\r\n                often too little too late, and one or more team members had already left due to being overworked.\r\n                Not all management is like that, and the ones that trust their team members are the ones that triumph\r\n                over smaller obstacles before they become too big to handle.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </portfolio-modal>\r\n\r\n        <portfolio-modal :item=\"practices.plane\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                Often when I'm asked to support a certain feature, I have an ideal architecture in mind.\r\n                Unfortunately, we don't often have time to build the ideal architecture, as the client needs results fast.\r\n                This is when the utopian architecture has to be split into phases, but done so in such a way that the end\r\n                of each phase is stable, and the amount of rewriting in subsequent phases is minimized.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                All of the patterns mentioned already play a significant role in this. By building SOLID code with\r\n                singular points of failure (DRY), tapering off the complex parts architecture (Let's Go Deeper) in ways\r\n                that can be expanded later (Work for the Future), you deliver a minimally viable production quickly,\r\n                but still ultimately provide the client what they really need (Tire Swing).\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The mentality behind \"Build the Plane as you Fly\" pairs incredibly well with the Agile process.\r\n                You can quite easily break up the individual steps into sprints, and start estimating when the client\r\n                will be able to initially use the product, as well as when the product is holistically finished.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                An additional benefit of this design pattern is that it avoids over architecting in the code.\r\n                There are times where the perfect solution initially dreamt up is far more capable than what\r\n                the client ever needed. For example, after breaking up the solution into five phases, you\r\n                may discover that while the first phase was ready in week, the second in a month, and the\r\n                third in a quarter, the fourth and fifth phases were actually unnecessary. You can always\r\n                keep your design notes in case the additional phases are needed, but you don't have to\r\n                spend development time on them.\r\n            </p>\r\n        </portfolio-modal>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    import BannerButton from '@/components/BannerButton'\r\n    import BannerButtons from '@/components/BannerButtons'\r\n    import Jumbotron from '@/components/Jumbotron'\r\n    import PortfolioModal from '@/components/PortfolioModal'\r\n\r\n    export default {\r\n        components: {\r\n            Jumbotron,\r\n            PortfolioModal\r\n        },\r\n        computed: {\r\n            qualities() {\r\n                return {\r\n                    'virtuous': {\r\n                        'key': 'virtuous',\r\n                        'name': 'Be Virtuous',\r\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-coins',\r\n                        'color': 'yellow',\r\n                        'description': 'The three greatest virtues are laziness, impatience, and hubris'\r\n                    },\r\n                    'righteous': {\r\n                        'key': 'righteous',\r\n                        'name': 'Be Righteous',\r\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-check',\r\n                        'color': 'green',\r\n                        'description': 'Be justified in your actions, and accept when you\\'re wrong'\r\n                    },\r\n                    'committed': {\r\n                        'key': 'committed',\r\n                        'name': 'Be Committed',\r\n                        'icon': 'far fa-handshake',\r\n                        'color': 'cyan',\r\n                        'description': 'Get the job done, and put in the time to do it'\r\n                    },\r\n                    'initiative': {\r\n                        'key': 'initiative',\r\n                        'name': 'Show Initiative',\r\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-running',\r\n                        'color': 'gray',\r\n                        'description': 'Do what needs to be done, don\\'t wait to be told'\r\n                    },\r\n                    'leadership': {\r\n                        'key': 'leadership',\r\n                        'name': 'Show Leadership',\r\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-users',\r\n                        'color': 'purple',\r\n                        'description': 'Lead by example, and teach others the lessons you\\'ve learned'\r\n                    },\r\n                    'integrity':  {\r\n                        'key': 'integrity',\r\n                        'name': 'Show Integrity',\r\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-shield-alt',\r\n                        'color': 'red',\r\n                        'description': 'Be the rock for your team, and stand your ground on ethical issues'\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            },\r\n\r\n            practices() {\r\n                return {\r\n                    'solid': {\r\n                        'key': 'solid',\r\n                        'name': 'S.O.L.I.D.',\r\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-cubes',\r\n                        'color': 'green',\r\n                        'thumbnail': null,\r\n                        'description': 'The SOLID design principles help make software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.'\r\n                    },\r\n                    'dry': {\r\n                        'key': 'dry',\r\n                        'name': 'Don\\'t Repeat Yourself',\r\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-retweet',\r\n                        'color': 'red',\r\n                        'thumbnail': null,\r\n                        'description': 'DRY comes in many forms, and can quickly become a plague if not taken seriously.'\r\n                    },\r\n                    'deeper': {\r\n                        'key': 'deeper',\r\n                        'name': 'Let\\'s Go Deeper',\r\n                        'icon': 'fab fa-superpowers',\r\n                        'color': 'purple',\r\n                        'thumbnail': null,\r\n                        'description': 'Don\\'t bore or confuse the reader with unnecessary details.
