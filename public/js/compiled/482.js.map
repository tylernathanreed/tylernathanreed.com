Their first approach is typically to copy the entire class or architecture,\n                then proceed to paste and rename it under a different namespace or class name, and lastly make the small handful of changes that\n                they needed.\n                <br><br>\n                This results in having two strikingly similar processes, but they don't actually <i>share</i> this functionality\n                at a definitional level. The proper approach would have been to abstract the existing implementation, then define the existing\n                implementation as just one of the concrete mechanisms, and lastly describe their new functionality as a second concrete implementation.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                <b>2)</b> Different Implementations for each Use Case\n                <br><br>\n                In some of the financially focused applications I've worked on, we've naturally had several financial calculations.\n                Some of these calculations were rather complex, and could be broken down into smaller pieces.

While they may not immediately effect you now, they'll\n                definitely effect you in the future. If you treat warnings of future problems like many people treat global warming,\n                the world will end up on fire, and you'll be left in confusion while the forecasters of the world say \"I told you so\".\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                I've unfortunately seen this situation in more than one company I've worked at, and it always stemmed from\n                management not appealing to the warnings of the developers or analysts. Even if they did listen, it was\n                often too little too late, and one or more team members had already left due to being overworked.\n                Not all management is like that, and the ones that trust their team members are the ones that triumph\n                over smaller obstacles before they become too big to handle.\n            </p>\n        </portfolio-modal>\n\n        <portfolio-modal :item=\"practices.plane\">\n            <p>\n                Often when I'm asked to support a certain feature, I have an ideal architecture in mind.\n                Unfortunately, we don't often have time to build the ideal architecture, as the client needs results fast.\n                This is when the utopian architecture has to be split into phases, but done so in such a way that the end\n                of each phase is stable, and the amount of rewriting in subsequent phases is minimized.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                All of the patterns mentioned already play a significant role in this. By building SOLID code with\n                singular points of failure (DRY), tapering off the complex parts architecture (Let's Go Deeper) in ways\n                that can be expanded later (Work for the Future), you deliver a minimally viable production quickly,\n                but still ultimately provide the client what they really need (Tire Swing).\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                The mentality behind \"Build the Plane as you Fly\" pairs incredibly well with the Agile process.\n                You can quite easily break up the individual steps into sprints, and start estimating when the client\n                will be able to initially use the product, as well as when the product is holistically finished.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                An additional benefit of this design pattern is that it avoids over architecting in the code.\n                There are times where the perfect solution initially dreamt up is far more capable than what\n                the client ever needed. For example, after breaking up the solution into five phases, you\n                may discover that while the first phase was ready in week, the second in a month, and the\n                third in a quarter, the fourth and fifth phases were actually unnecessary. You can always\n                keep your design notes in case the additional phases are needed, but you don't have to\n                spend development time on them.\n            </p>\n        </portfolio-modal>\n    </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\n    import BannerButton from '@/components/BannerButton'\n    import BannerButtons from '@/components/BannerButtons'\n    import Jumbotron from '@/components/Jumbotron'\n    import PortfolioModal from '@/components/PortfolioModal'\n\n    export default {\n        components: {\n            Jumbotron,\n            PortfolioModal\n        },\n        computed: {\n            qualities() {\n                return {\n                    'virtuous': {\n                        'key': 'virtuous',\n                        'name': 'Be Virtuous',\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-coins',\n                        'color': 'yellow',\n                        'description': 'The three greatest virtues are laziness, impatience, and hubris'\n                    },\n                    'righteous': {\n                        'key': 'righteous',\n                        'name': 'Be Righteous',\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-check',\n                        'color': 'green',\n                        'description': 'Be justified in your actions, and accept when you\\'re wrong'\n                    },\n                    'committed': {\n                        'key': 'committed',\n                        'name': 'Be Committed',\n                        'icon': 'far fa-handshake',\n                        'color': 'cyan',\n                        'description': 'Get the job done, and put in the time to do it'\n                    },\n                    'initiative': {\n                        'key': 'initiative',\n                        'name': 'Show Initiative',\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-running',\n                        'color': 'gray',\n                        'description': 'Do what needs to be done, don\\'t wait to be told'\n                    },\n                    'leadership': {\n                        'key': 'leadership',\n                        'name': 'Show Leadership',\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-users',\n                        'color': 'purple',\n                        'description': 'Lead by example, and teach others the lessons you\\'ve learned'\n                    },\n                    'integrity':  {\n                        'key': 'integrity',\n                        'name': 'Show Integrity',\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-shield-alt',\n                        'color': 'red',\n                        'description': 'Be the rock for your team, and stand your ground on ethical issues'\n                    }\n                }\n            },\n\n            practices() {\n                return {\n                    'solid': {\n                        'key': 'solid',\n                        'name': 'S.O.L.I.D.',\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-cubes',\n                        'color': 'green',\n                        'thumbnail': null,\n                        'description': 'The SOLID design principles help make software more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.'\n                    },\n                    'dry': {\n                        'key': 'dry',\n                        'name': 'Don\\'t Repeat Yourself',\n                        'icon': 'fas fa-retweet',\n                        'color': 'red',\n                        'thumbnail': null,\n                        'description': 'DRY comes in many forms, and can quickly become a plague if not taken seriously.'\n                    },\n                    'deeper': {\n                        'key': 'deeper',\n                        'name': 'Let\\'s Go Deeper',\n                        'icon': 'fab fa-superpowers',\n                        'color': 'purple',\n                        'thumbnail': null,\n                        'description': 'Don\\'t bore or confuse the reader with unnecessary details.
